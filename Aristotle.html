        	Aristotle moved to Athens from his native Stageira in 367 BCE and began to study philosophy, possibly with Isocrates, eventually enrolling at <a href="Plato.html"> Plato </a>'s Academy. Aristotle left Athens around twenty years later to study botany and zoology, became a tutor of Alexander the Great, and ultimately returned to Athens a further decade later to found his own school, the Lyceum. At least twenty-nine of his treatises have survived as part of the corpus Aristotelicum on a wide variety of subjects, including logic, physics, optics, metaphysics, ethics, rhetoric, politics, poetry, botany, and zoology. <br/>
Aristotle is often portrayed as disagreeing with his teacher, Plato, and is represented as such in Raphael's School of Athens. Aristotle criticizes the regimes described in Plato's Republic and Laws, and calls the theory of forms a bunch of "empty words and poetic metaphors." Aristotle is generally presented as giving greater weight to empirical and practical concerns. <br/>
<br/>
Aristotle's fame was not great during the Hellenistic period, when Stoic logic was in vogue, but later peripatetic commentators popularized his work; it formed the basis of Islamic, Jewish, and Christian Medieval philosophy.  His influence was such that Avicenna referred to him simply as "the Master"; Maimonides, Alfarabi, Averroes, and Aquinas call him just "the Philosopher."<br/>
